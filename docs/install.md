# How to Install

Download the latest version of the plugin files from the [releases](https://github.com/wanglin2/obsidian-simplemindmap/releases) page. You only need to download the following three files: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.

After downloading, navigate to the `/.obsidian/plugins/` folder in the root directory of your Obsidian vault. If you have already installed community plugins, you can directly open Obsidian, go to Settings → Community plugins → Installed plugins, and click the folder icon on the right side to open the plugins folder.

After opening the folder, create a new folder named `obsidian-simplemindmap`, then copy the three downloaded files into this folder.

Reopen Obsidian, go to Settings → Community plugins → Installed plugins, click the refresh icon button on the right, and you will see the plugin listed. Click "Enable" to activate it.
